      <h2>About FinWise</h2>
      <p>FinWise merges expense tracking with bite-sized financial learning and personalized tips. It is a static, frontend prototype designed to demonstrate how an integrated personal finance app can help students and early earners make smarter money decisions.</p>

      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p><em>Most young earners and students lack accessible tools that combine personal finance tracking with simplified financial learning. Despite using expense trackers or reading finance blogs separately, there is no unified platform that helps users understand, analyze, and improve their financial behavior through personalized insights and educational resources.</em></p>

      <h3>Explanation of the Problem</h3>
      <p>In today’s digital era, people — especially students, first-time jobholders, and early professionals — often struggle with financial management and literacy. While there are apps that track expenses, they typically fail to educate users on why they overspend or how to improve their financial habits. Conversely, finance learning platforms are often theoretical, fragmented, or intimidating, offering little connection to users’ real financial data. This creates a gap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users track data but don’t learn from it.</li>
        <li>They read finance content but can’t relate it to their real-life spending.</li>
        <li>AI tools exist for trading or investment, but not for personalized money habits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How FinWise Helps</h3>
      <p>FinWise aims to bridge this gap by merging financial tracking, AI-driven insights, and educational resources in one place. It helps users make sense of their expenses, compare them with averages, and learn key financial concepts in context — creating awareness through action. Key features demonstrated in this prototype include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track income and expenses with per-user storage (demo uses localStorage).</li>
        <li>Explain relevant financial concepts with contextual, bite-sized learning modules.</li>
        <li>Provide rule-based, demo AI-style advice (e.g., “You spent 30% more on food this month — here’s how to budget better.”).</li>
        <li>Surface news and trends to keep users informed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real-life Scenario</h3>
      <p>Meet Aarav, a 22-year-old student who just started his first internship. He uses a few different apps: one for tracking expenses, another for reading economic news, and sometimes watches finance videos on YouTube. Despite all this, Aarav still finds himself overspending, forgetting savings goals, and feeling clueless about basic finance terms like inflation, mutual funds, or compound interest.</p>
      <p>What Aarav needs isn’t just an expense tracker — he needs understanding. He needs to see his spending trends, learn what they mean, and act on personalized advice — all in one smart, easy-to-use tool. FinWise aims to provide that experience.</p>

      <h3>Demo & Extensibility</h3>
      <p>This prototype focuses on client-side interactions to demonstrate the UX and core flows. For production, the project can be extended with a backend (Firebase or Node/Express + DB), real News and Currency APIs, and secure authentication — see the README for suggested next steps.</p>
